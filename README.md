# school-scraper

This is a tool I created that scrapes all of the different class websites and combines all of the assignments due for the week into one table for ease of viewing. I made it since it was getting really annoying to switch between different websites to see my assignemnts. 

Created with selenium, BeautifulSoup, and pandas.
